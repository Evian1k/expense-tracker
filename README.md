## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
This optimizes the app for the best performance in production mode, with minified files and hashed filenames.

### `npm run eject`

**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

If you want to customize the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject. This removes the build dependency and copies all configuration files (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project for full control.

However, **you don't need to eject** unless you're sure you need more custom configuration. For most projects, sticking with the default configuration is the best choice.

  ```
  netlify deploy
  ```
- Alternatively, you can drag and drop the `build` folder to Netlify's web UI for deployment.

3. **Continuous Deployment**: 
- You can link your GitHub repository to Netlify for continuous deployment. Every time you push updates to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy the latest version of your app.

Your app will be available at the Netlify URL once deployed. You can also customize the URL and manage settings via the Netlify dashboard.
